# Understanding Probabilistic Topic Models By Simulation

## Overview

### Description

Latent Dirichlet Allocation and related topic models are often presented in the form of complicated equations and confusing diagrams. I will present LDA as a generative model through probabilistic simulation in simple Python. Simulation will help data scientists to understand the model assumptions and limitations and more effectively use black box LDA implementations.

### Abstract

Those without training in probabilistic graphical models and measure theory, data scientist may have a hard time understanding Latent Dirichlet Allocation and other probabilistic topic models. However, because LDA is a generative model, we can write Python code to generated data based on the model assumptions.

The talk will progress as follows:

* Introduction to mixture models
* Simulation of mixture models
* Introduction to grouped data
* Simulation of latent Dirichlet allocation
* ~~Fitting and visualizing LDA with Python~~
